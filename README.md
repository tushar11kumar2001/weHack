  - we proposed this project in concern of a situation as lots of death were reported due to the backflow of blood in absence of proper monitoring.
  - Smart Salinity Monitoring system is capable to prevent such mishap to the patient. 
  - Arduino programming along with saline bottle is used to build prototype (hardware)
  - Doctors will get a message whenever glucose bottle of the patient is about to get empty .
